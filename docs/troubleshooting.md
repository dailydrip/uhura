# Uhura Troubleshooting Guide

This document contains information that may help you troubleshoot issues you may encounter while installing, configuring and/or running Uhura.

## Missing Environment Variables

The **envied** gem ensures that the environment variables you specify in Envfile exist.

If  you have not sourced your .env file in your development environment and attempt to start the Rails Console you may encounter the following:

```
$ bundle exec rails console
DEPRECATION WARNING: Default values will be removed in the next minor-release of ENVied (i.e. > v0.9). For more info see https://gitlab.com/envied/envied/tree/0-9-releases#defaults. (called from block in load at /home/lex/Clients/Concur/Projects/uhura/Envfile:4)

If you get " Permission denied (publickey)" then you likely need to setup your github public key.  

Try running `ssh -T git@github.com` Do you get a `Permission denied (publickey)`error?

```
$ ssh -T git@github.com

## "environment variables" Errors when Running rspec

```
$ bundle exec rspec
rspec pid: 697
DEPRECATION WARNING: Default values will be removed in the next minor-release of ENVied (i.e. > v0.9). For more info see https://gitlab.com/envied/envied/tree/0-9-releases#defaults. (called from block in load at /home/lex/Projects/uhura/Envfile:4)

```

Export the missing environment variables and try again:

```
$ . .env
$ bundle exec rspec
rspec pid: 5239
DEPRECATION WARNING: Default values will be removed in the next minor-release of ENVied (i.e. > v0.9). For more info see https://gitlab.com/envied/envied/tree/0-9-releases#defaults. (called from block in load at /home/lex/Projects/uhura/Envfile:4)

## Hanging RSpec processes

When an rspec process is already running (did not terminate) rspec will hang shortly after starting. Run this alias to kill any running rspec processes and start rspec (without it hanging).

### Solution

Run `be-rspec` alias rather than `bundle exec rspec`.  

```
alias be-rspec='ps -ef | grep -v grep|grep "\/rspec" | while read line; do pid2kill="$(echo \"$line\" | awk '\''{print $2}'\'')"; if [ "$pid2kill" != "" ]; then kill -9 $pid2kill; fi; done; bundle exec rspec'
```

Run `print-rspec-stacktrace` to see the stacktrace when it appears rspec is hung.

```
# Print rspec stacktrace. Assumes trap 'USR1' has been created in spec_helper.rb.
alias print-rspec-stacktrace='kill -USR1 "$(cat /tmp/rspec.pid)"'
```



## Missing Postgres Library

If you chose not to install the Postgres database in the server instance where you install Uhura, then you'll need to install the C++ client API for PostgreSQL.

You'll see something similar to this if you try to run bundle on your workstation without either PostgreSQL server or it's client library installed:

```
$ bundle
. . .
Fetching pg 1.1.4
Installing pg 1.1.4 with native extensions
Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

*** extconf.rb failed ***
Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary
libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more details.  You may
need configuration options.
```

### Solution

Here's how you could install the PostgreSQL client library on an Ubuntu server:

```
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```



## This Api Key does not exist

If you happen to do that and get a message like the following, you can lookup the Authorization Bearer and public_token values using ActiveRecord queries:

```
uhura> Manager.find_by(name: 'Sample - App 1').public_token
"deadbeef00deadbeef01"

uhura> Manager.find_by(name: 'Sample - App 1').api_keys.map { |i| i.auth_token }
[
    [0] "beef0beef1beef2beef3"
]

```



### Failed Request
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/messages \
  -H 'Accept: */*' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer dead0dead1dead2dead3' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

    "receiver_sso_id": "63501603",
    "email_subject": "Picnic Saturday",
    "email_message": {
	  "header": "Dragon Rage",
	  "section1": "imagine you are writing an email. you are in front of the computer. you are operating the computer, clicking a mouse and typing on a keyboard, but the message will be sent to a human over the internet. so you are working before the computer, but with a human behind the computer.",
	  "button": "Count me in!"
	},
    "template_id": "d-05d33214e6994b01b577602036bfa9f5",
    "sms_message": "Bring Drinks to the Picnic this Saturday"
}'
```

### Response
```
{"error":"This Api Key does not exist."}
```



### Solution

The auth_token gets reset when you run `bundle exec rake db:drop`

You can either run `bundle exec db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed`to generate a new one, which will be displayed in the console, see below:



```
$  bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed
. . .

2. Seeding ApiKeys
3. Seeding Teams
4. Seeding Templates
5. Seeding Users
6. Seeding MsgTarget
Seeding Done!

Authorization Bearer token: beef0beef1beef2beef3

```

    "sms_message": "Bring Drinks to the Picnic this Saturday"
}'
```

### Response

Note that Uhura's message response encapsulates two message service provider responses (one from Sendgrid and the other from Clearstream).

```
{
    "sendgrid_msg": {
        "value": {
            "status": 202,
            "data": {
                "sendgrid_msg": "Asynchronously sent email: (Leadership Team:Picnic Saturday) from (Sample - App 1) to (charles.jarrett@live.com <Charles Jarrett>)"
            },
            "error": null
        },
        "error": null
    },
    "clearstream_msg": {
        "value": null,
        "error": {
            "status": 422,
            "data": null,
            "error": {
                "msg": "At least one of the supplied subscribers is invalid.",
                "action_required:": {
                    "error_from_clearstream": "At least one of the supplied subscribers is invalid.",
                    "assumed_meaning": "This receiver w/ mobile_number (2056132729) not registered in Clearstream",
                    "action": "Research whether receiver_sso_id (63501603) is valid."
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

NOTE: The response above shows that the email was sent successfully, but the SMS message failed.
